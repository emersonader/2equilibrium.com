This incredible energy demand means your brain is constantly seeking efficiency. It prefers established routines because they require less conscious effort and therefore less energy.

It triggers a series of metabolic adaptations and hormonal changes designed to bring your weight back up. This can include:\n\n• Increased Appetite: Hormones like ghrelin (the hunger hormone) increase, making you feel hungrier.\n• Decreased Satiety: Hormones like leptin (the fullness hormone) decrease, making it harder to feel satisfied after eating.\n• Reduced Energy Expenditure: Your metabolism slows down, meaning your body burns fewer calories at rest.\n\nThese powerful biological forces are incredibly difficult to override with sheer willpower alone. Your brain and body are working together to restore what they perceive as their optimal operating weight, making sustained rapid loss a monumental challenge."
